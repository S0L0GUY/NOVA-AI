The walls are made of dark wood panels and brick, with a wall of posters on the right. Glass doors open into a lobby area with a reception desk, plants, and a large, dark, textured feature on the back wall with glowing eyes. A neon \"OPEN\" sign hangs inside. A menu panel is visible on the left, listing options like BGM, Chairs, and TV Screens. There are no players visible."}]
