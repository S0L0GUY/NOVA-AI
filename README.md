### Step 3: Install Additional Dependencies

Some packages may require additional setup:

**For Audio Processing:**
```powershell
pip install pyaudio
```

If PyAudio fails to install:
1. Download the appropriate .whl file from [here](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pyaudio)
2. Install it with: `pip install path\to\downloaded\file.whl`

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Configure Audio Devices

1. **Find your audio device indices:**
   ```powershell
   python list_audio_devices.py
   ```
2. Note the index numbers for your microphone (input) and speakers (output)

3. **Edit the constants.py file:**
   - Open `constants.py` in a text editor
   - Update the `AUDIO_INPUT_INDEX` and `AUDIO_OUTPUT_INDEX` values:
   ```python
   class Audio:
       AUDIO_OUTPUT_INDEX = 7  # Replace with your speaker index
       AUDIO_INPUT_INDEX = 2   # Replace with your microphone index
   ```

### Step 2: Set Up OpenAI API

1. **Get an OpenAI API key:**
   - Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
   - Create an account or sign in
   - Navigate to API Keys section
   - Create a new API key

2. **Set up your API key:**
   
   **Method 1: Environment Variable (Recommended)**
   - Open Command Prompt as Administrator
   - Run: `setx OPENAI_API_KEY "your-api-key-here"`
   - Restart your computer

   **Method 2: Direct Configuration**
   - Edit the constants.py file and add your API key where needed

### Step 3: Configure VRChat OSC

1. **Enable OSC in VRChat:**
   - Launch VRChat
   - Go to Settings ‚Üí OSC
   - Enable "Enabled"
   - Note the port number (usually 9000)

2. **Update network settings:**
   - The `constants.py` file should automatically detect your IP
   - Verify the `VRC_PORT` matches VRChat's OSC port

### Step 4: Test Audio Setup

1. **Test your microphone:**
   ```powershell
   python -c "import sounddevice as sd; print('Audio devices:'); print(sd.query_devices())"
   ```

2. **Test text-to-speech:**
   ```powershell
   python list_voices.py
   ```

### Adjusting Voice Settings

In `constants.py`, modify the `Voice` class:
```python
class Voice:
    VOICE_NAME = "en-US-JennyNeural"  # Change to your preferred voice
```

### Model Configuration

Adjust AI model settings in the `LanguageModel` class in `constants.py`:
```python
class LanguageModel:
    MODEL_ID = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # or "gpt-4" for better responses
    LM_TEMPERATURE = 0.7        # Creativity level (0.0-1.0)
