## Configuration System

NOVA AI features a revolutionary **centralized configuration system** that makes customization and tuning incredibly simple. Instead of hunting through multiple files to change settings, everything is organized in one place: `constants.py`.

### üéØ **Why This Matters**

Before the constants system, changing NOVA's behavior meant:
- ‚ùå Searching through multiple Python files
- ‚ùå Finding hardcoded values scattered everywhere  
- ‚ùå Risk of breaking the code with incorrect edits
- ‚ùå No clear documentation of what each value does

Now with the constants system:
- ‚úÖ **One file controls everything** - `constants.py`
- ‚úÖ **Organized by purpose** - Network, Audio, AI, Voice, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Clear documentation** - Every setting has explanatory comments
- ‚úÖ **Safe to modify** - Designed specifically for user customization
- ‚úÖ **Easy to backup** - Save your perfect configuration in one file

### üèóÔ∏è **How It's Organized**

The `constants.py` file contains configuration classes grouped by functionality:

```python
class Network:          # All networking settings (IPs, ports)
class Audio:           # Audio device configuration  
class Voice:           # Text-to-speech settings
class LanguageModel:   # AI model configuration
class WhisperSettings: # Speech recognition tuning
class OpenAI:          # OpenAI/LM Studio API settings
class TTSSettings:     # Text-to-speech engine options
class FilePaths:       # All file and folder locations
# ... and more!
```

### üîß **Configuration Benefits**

- **üéöÔ∏è Fine-tune Performance**: Adjust speech recognition sensitivity, AI creativity, response speed
- **üé≠ Customize Personality**: Modify system prompts and AI behavior  
- **üîä Perfect Audio**: Set exact audio device indices and voice preferences
- **‚ö° Optimize Speed**: Balance between accuracy and response time
- **üåê Network Flexibility**: Easy port and IP configuration for different setups
- **üìä Monitor Control**: Customize the resource monitor appearance and behavior

### üìñ **Simple Example**

Want to make NOVA more creative? Just open `constants.py` and change:
```python
class LanguageModel:
    LM_TEMPERATURE = 0.9  # Changed from 0.7 to 0.9 for more creativity
```

Want better speech recognition? Update:
```python
class WhisperSettings:
    MODEL_SIZE = "small"  # Changed from "base" for better accuracy
```

That's it! The entire codebase automatically uses your new settings.
